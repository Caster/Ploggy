This is the main page of Ploggy (and currently the only one). Here, you see a 
GitHub-like overview of your project, but focused on what you logged instead of 
what you committed in Git. The two bars indicate your progress. The top bar is 
the time progression (how many days passed), while the bottom one is how much 
time you logged. At the end of the day, when you have logged what you did, the 
bars should be approximately the same length. You can also look at the 
percentages shown in the overview above the bars of course.
