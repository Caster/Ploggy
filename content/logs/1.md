Log entries can be formatted using 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), thanks to the 
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) library!

  - so stuff like lists are no problem
  - you see?

And you can make paragraphs, **bold** and *italic* text, et cetera!

Adding log entries is easy, thanks to [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/) commands. For 
example, <kbd>$ <kbd>nanoc al 09:00 17:00</kbd></kbd> adds a log entry for today. You can 
run nanoc `al -h` to see a list of options. What this will do is create a new 
file in the `content/logs` folder with some default content in it that you can 
edit. The first entry will be `0.md`, then `1.md`, et cetera.

To configure the name of your project, persons involved, ..., edit the 
`PloggyConfigHelper` in `lib/helpers/ploggy_config.rb`. Currently, Ploggy 
assumes that you work Monday through Friday, but this may be configurable in the 
future.
