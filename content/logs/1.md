Log entries can be formatted using 
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), thanks to the 
[kramdown](http://kramdown.gettalong.org/) library!

  - so stuff like lists are no problem
  - you see?

And you can make paragraphs, **bold** and *italic* text, et cetera!

Adding log entries is easy, thanks to [nanoc](http://nanoc.ws/) commands.

```
  $ nanoc al 09:00 17:00
```

Adds a log entry for today. You can run nanoc `al -h` to see a list of options. 
What this will do is create a new file in the `content/logs` folder with some 
default content in it that you can edit. The first entry will be `0.md`, then 
`1.md`, et cetera.
